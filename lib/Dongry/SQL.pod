=head1 NAME

Dongry::SQL - SQL construction functions for Dongry

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Dongry::SQL;
  $quoted_identifier = quote $string;
  $like = '%' . (like $string) . '%';
  $fields = fields ['column1', 'column2'];
  $where = where {column1 => $value1, column2 => {-lt => $value2}};
  $order = order [column1 => 1, column2 => -1];

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<Dongry::SQL> module defines functions to construct components of
SQL statements.  They are called by various methods of Dongry modules.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

The following functions are exported by default when the module is
C<use>d:

=over 4

=item $quoted_identifier = quote $string

Quote the string by C<`> characters and escape any C<`> character in
the given string such that the given string can be interpreted as an
SQL identifier.

=item $like = like $string

Escape metacharacters in C<LIKE> comparison (i.e. C<%>, C<_>, and
C<\>) in the given string.

=item $fields = fields $field_specification

XXX


If nothing is specified, or an C<undef> value is specified, all
columns, i.e. C<*>, are selected.

If a string is specified, that is considered as a column name.

If a bare SQL fragment object (returned by the C<bare_sql_fragment>
method) is specified, the specified string is used as is.

Hash references with name-value pairs are converted to function calls
whose function name is specified by the key and the argument is
specified by the value.  Following function names are available:
C<-count> (in SQL, C<COUNT()>), C<-min> (in SQL, C<MIN()>), C<-max>
(in SQL, C<MAX()>), and C<-sum> (in SQL, C<SUM()>).  In addition,
following name-value pairs can be specified in the hash reference: C<<
as => name >> names an alias for the function value (in SQL,
C<function() AS name>), and C<< distinct => boolean >> adds the
C<DISTINCT> keyword (in SQL, C<function(DISTINCT args)>).

These values can be combined as an array reference, for retrieving one
or more of those values.

Examples:

  [undef, 'c1']                   # *, `c1`
  [{-count => undef}, 'c1', 'c2'] # COUNT(*), `c1`, `c2`
  [{-count => 'c1',
    as => 'c',
    distinct => 1}]               # COUNT(DISTINCT `c1`) AS `c`

=item $where = where $where_specification [, $schema]

XXX

XXX I<named placeholder> is ...

=item $order = order $order_specification

XXX

They must be specified as
B<array> reference of name/value pairs, where names represent column
names and values represent their sort order.  The values must be
either C<ASC>, C<asc>, or C<1> (ascending order) or C<DESC>, C<desc>,
or C<-1> (descending order).

Examples:

  [col1 => 1, col2 => -1]          # `col1` ASC, `col2` DESC
  [col1 => 'ASC', col2 => 'DESC']  # `col1` ASC, `col2` DESC

=back

As a general rule, these methods accept both utf8-flagged and
utf8-unflagged strings.  However, they must not be appear in the same
function call.  If the input is utf8-flagged, the output will also be
utf8-flagged.  If the input is unflagged, the output will be
unflagged, either.

These methods try to construct a valid SQL fragment as far as
possible, but they does not output a valid fragment for every input.
For example, if the input contains a U+0000 NULL character, the output
will also contain it.  If the input contains an unflagged broken UTF-8
sequence, functions preserve them as is.  This limitation would not be
problem in most situations as serving an untrusted value as (say) a
column name is uncommon and even when it happens it will simply cause
an SQL parse error and is not believed to make any vulnerablility by
itself.

=head1 SUPPORTED SYNTAX

The module only supports SQL syntax for MySQL5.
