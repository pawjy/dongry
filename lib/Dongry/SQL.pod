=head1 NAME

Dongry::SQL - SQL construction functions for Dongry

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Dongry::SQL;
  $quoted_identifier = quote $string;
  $like = '%' . (like $string) . '%';
  $fields = fields ['column1', 'column2'];
  $where = where {column1 => $value1, column2 => {-lt => $value2}};
  $order = order [column1 => 1, column2 => -1];

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<Dongry::SQL> module defines functions to construct components of
SQL statements.  They are called by various methods of Dongry modules.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

The following functions are exported by default when the module is
C<use>d:

=over 4

=item $quoted_identifier = quote $string

Quote the string by C<`> characters and escape any C<`> character in
the given string such that the given string can be interpreted as an
SQL identifier.

=item $like = like $string

Escape metacharacters in C<LIKE> comparison (i.e. C<%>, C<_>, and
C<\>) in the given string.

=item $fields = fields $field_specification

Compose the "fields" portion of the C<SELECT> statement.

The argument must be the "fields" struct, i.e. one of the following
values:

=over 4

=item - C<undef>

If the value is not defined, all columns, i.e. C<*>, is assumed.

=item - String

If a string is specified, that is considered as a column name.

=item - Bare SQL fragment object

If a bare SQL fragment object (returned by the C<bare_sql_fragment>
method of the database object) is specified, the specified string is
used as is.

=item - Hash reference

A hash reference with key/value pairs are converted to function calls
whose function name is specified by the key and the argument is
specified by the value.  Following function names are available:
C<-count> (in SQL, C<COUNT()>), C<-min> (in SQL, C<MIN()>), C<-max>
(in SQL, C<MAX()>), and C<-sum> (in SQL, C<SUM()>).  In addition,
following name-value pairs can be specified in the hash reference: 
C<< as => name >> names an alias for the function value (in SQL,
C<function() AS name>), and C<< distinct => boolean >> adds the
C<DISTINCT> keyword (in SQL, C<function(DISTINCT args)>).

=item - Array reference

These values can be combined as an array reference, to combine one or
more of those values.

=back

Examples:

  [undef, 'c1']                   # *, `c1`
  [{-count => undef}, 'c1', 'c2'] # COUNT(*), `c1`, `c2`
  [{-count => 'c1',
    as => 'c',
    distinct => 1}]               # COUNT(DISTINCT `c1`) AS `c`

=item $where = where $where_specification [, $table_schema]

Compose the C<WHERE> clause of an SQL statement.  It does not include
the C<WHERE> keyword itself.

The first argument must be specified.  It represents the generated
C<WHERE> clause.  The second argument, if specified, must be a table
schema, as described in the L<Dongry::Database> documentation.  If the
table schema is specified, the function operates in a I<schema-aware>
way.  Otherwise, the function operates in a I<schema-unaware> way.  If
it is schema-aware, the column values are serialized as described in
the L<Dongry::Table> documentation before being part of an SQL
statement.

The first argument must be a "where" struct, which must be one of the
following values:

=over 4

=item - Hash reference

If a hash reference is specified, it must contain a key/value pair.

The key is interpreted as the column name.

If the value is not a hash reference, it is equivalent to specifying a
hash reference whoes key is C<-eq> and whoes value is the specified
value.

If the value is a hash reference, it must contain a key/value pair
whose key is one of the following values:

=over 4

=item C<-eq> or C<==>

If the value is C<undef>, the entire key/value pair represents the SQL
expression C<column IS NULL> where I<column> is the column name.

Otherwise, the entire key/value pair represents the SQL expression
C<column = ?> where I<column> is the column name and I<?> is the
value.

=item C<-ne>, C<-not>, or C<!=>

If the value is C<undef>, the entire key/value pair represents the SQL
expression C<column IS NOT NULL> where I<column> is the column name.

Otherwise, the entire key/value pair represents the SQL expression
C<column != ?> where I<column> is the column name and I<?> is the
value.

=item C<-lt> or C<< < >>

The entire key/value pair represents the SQL expression C<< column < ?
>> where I<column> is the column name and I<?> is the value.

=item C<-le> or C<< <= >>

The entire key/value pair represents the SQL expression C<< column <=
? >> where I<column> is the column name and I<?> is the value.

=item C<-gt> or C<< > >>

The entire key/value pair represents the SQL expression C<< column > ?
>> where I<column> is the column name and I<?> is the value.

=item C<-ge> or C<< >= >>

The entire key/value pair represents the SQL expression C<< column >=
? >> where I<column> is the column name and I<?> is the value.

=item C<-like>

The entire key/value pair represents the SQL expression C<column LIKE
?> where I<column> is the column name and I<?> is the value.

=item C<-prefix>

The entire key/value pair represents the SQL C<LIKE> expression for
the column where the condition is that it starts by the value.

=item C<-suffix>

The entire key/value pair represents the SQL C<LIKE> expression for
the column where the condition is that it ends by the value.

=item C<-infix>

The entire key/value pair represents the SQL C<LIKE> expression for
the column where the condition is that it contains the value.

=item C<-regexp>

The entire key/value pair represents the SQL expression C<column
REGEXP ?> where I<column> is the column name and I<?> is the value.

=item C<-in>

The entire key/value pair represents the SQL expression C<column IN
(?, ?, ..., ?)> where I<column> is the column name.  The value must be
an array reference or a blessed array reference containing the column
values for the C<(?, ?, ..., ?)> portion.  It must not be empty.

=back

Column values are interpreted in schema-aware ways if a table schema
is given to the function.

Examples:

  {foo => 'bar'}                   # `foo` = 'bar'
  {foo => {-ne => undef}}          # `foo` IS NOT NULL
  {foo => {-prefix => '40%'}}      # `foo` LIKE '40\%%'
  {foo => {-in => ['abc', 'def']}} # `foo` IN ('abc', 'def')

=item - Array reference

If an array reference is specified, it must be a fragment of the SQL
statement with named placeholders followed by zero or more key/value
pairs.  It represents the SQL statement whoes placeholders are
replaced by the key/value pairs.

The SQL statement with I<named placeholders> is a string that can
contain the following syntax:

=over 4

=item :I<key>

Replaced by the value of the key/value pair whoes key is equal to
I<key>.  It is interpreted as an SQL quoted string.

If the table schema is available, the value is interpreted as the
value for the column whoes name is equal to I<key>.

=item I<column> I<operator> ?

Equivalent to C<< I<column> I<operator> :I<column> >>.

The I<operator> must be one of the following SQL operators: C<=>, C<<
<= >>, C<< < >>, C<< > >>, C<< >= >>, C<< <> >>, C<!=>, or C<< <=> >>.

=item :I<key>::I<column>

Replaced by the value of the key/value pair whoes key is equal to
I<key>.  It is interpreted as an SQL quoted string.

If the table schema is available, the value is interpreted as the
value for the column whoes name is equal to I<column>.

=item :I<key>:id

Replaced by the value of the key/value pair whoes key is equal to
I<key>.  It is interpreted as an SQL identifier.

Since Dongry does not support non-ASCII identifiers, the value must be
an unflagged ASCII-only string.

=item :I<key>:sub

Replaced by the value of the key/value pair whoes key is equal to
I<key>.  It is interpreted as an SQL expression.  The value must be a
"where" construct.

=back

Please note that Dongry does not assure the output is a (fragment of)
valid SQL statement.  The application must specify a string with
key/value pairs that would be result in a valid SQL statement.

Examples:

  ['foo = :foo OR bar = :bar',  # foo = 'abc' OR bar = 'def'
   foo => 'abc', bar => 'def']
  ['foo = ?', foo => 'abc']     # foo = 'abc'

  $lang = 'en';
  [':namecol:id = :name',       # `name_en` = 'abc'
   namecol => 'name_' . $lang,
   name => 'abc']
  
  # (`created` is of 'timestamp_as_DateTime'
  #  and $date1 and $date2 are DateTime objects)
  [':created1::created <= created AND
   created <= :created2::created',
   created1 => $date1, created2 => $date2]      
  # ? <= created AND created <= ?
  # with serialized $date1, $date2
  
  [':cond1:sub OR :cond2:sub',   
   cond1 => {foo => 1, bar => 2},
   cond2 => {foo => 2, bar => 1}]
  # (`foo` = '1' AND `bar` = '2') OR
  # (`foo` = '2' AND `bar` = '1')

=back

=item $order = order $order_specification

Compose the C<ORDER BY> clause of an SQL statement.  It does not
include the C<ORDER BY> keywords themselves.

The argument must be an "order" struct.  It must be specified as an
B<array> reference containing name/value pairs, where names represent
column names and values represent their sort orders.  The values must
be either C<ASC>, C<asc>, or C<1> (ascending order) or C<DESC>,
C<desc>, or C<-1> (descending order).

Examples:

  [col1 => 1, col2 => -1]          # `col1` ASC, `col2` DESC
  [col1 => 'ASC', col2 => 'DESC']  # `col1` ASC, `col2` DESC

=back

As a general rule, these methods accept both utf8-flagged and
utf8-unflagged strings.  However, they must not be appear in the same
function call.  If the input is utf8-flagged, the output will also be
utf8-flagged.  If the input is unflagged, the output will be
unflagged, either.  For more information on how Dongry handles the
utf8 flag, see L<Dongry::Database> documentation.

These methods try to construct a valid SQL fragment as far as
possible, but they does not output a valid fragment for every input.
For example, if the input contains a U+0000 NULL character, the output
will also contain it.  If the input contains an unflagged broken UTF-8
sequence, functions preserve them as is.  This limitation would not be
problem in most situations as serving an untrusted value as (say) a
column name is uncommon and even when it happens it will simply cause
an SQL parse error and is not believed to make any vulnerablility by
itself.
